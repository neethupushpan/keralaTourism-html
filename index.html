                        some of the most popular tourist destinations in Kerala are beaches like Kovalam, Varkala, Chowara, Chavakkad, Nattika, Cherai, Kizhunna, Poovar and the list goes on and on.

                    <figcaption><b>Kovalam Beach:Trivandrum</b></figcaption>
                   
                    <p>Kovalam is an internationally renowned beach with three adjacent crescent beaches. It has been a favourite haunt of 
                    tourists since the 1930s. A massive rocky promontory on the beach has created a beautiful bay of calm waters ideal for sea bathing.
                    The leisure options at this beach are plenty and diverse. Sunbathing, swimming, herbal body toning massages, special cultural programmes and catamaran cruising are some of them. 
                    The tropical sun acts so fast that one can see the faint blush of coppery tan on the skin in a matter of minutes. Life on the beach begins late in the day and carries on well into the night.
                    The beach complex includes a string of budget cottages, Ayurvedic health resorts, convention facilities, shopping zones, swimming pools, Yoga and Ayurvedic massage centres.
                    Accommodation facilities for tourists at Kovalam range from five star hotels to budget hotels and the choice of food available at restaurants and cafeterias range from Continental 
                    varieties to South Indian delicacies.Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala, is just 16 km away from Kovalam and getting there is no hassle. But if you are on holiday it is better 
                    to stay in Kovalam and visit the city. The city of Thiruvananthapuram has many interesting places to see like the Napier Museum, the Sri Chitra Art Gallery and the Padmanabhaswamy Temple.

                    <h2 align="center">Backwaters</h2>
                    <p align="center"><strong>The scenic backwaters of Kerala comprise serene stretches of lakes, canals and lagoons located parallel to the coast of the Arabian Sea. 
                            The backwater regions of Kerala are one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. The tranquil backwater cruises are a once in a lifetime experience.
                             Alappuzha, known as the 'Venice of the East',is especially popular for its houseboat cruises where you can soak in nature at its finest form.</strong></p>

                    <p>Referred to as the Venice of the East, Alappuzha has always enjoyed an important place in the maritime history of Kerala. Today, it is famous for its boat races, backwater holidays, beaches, marine products and coir industry.
                        Alappuzha Beach is a popular picnic spot. The pier, which extends out to the sea here, is over 137 years old. Entertainment facilities at the Vijaya Beach Park add to the attraction of the beach. 
                        There is also an old lighthouse nearby which greatly intrigues all visitors.Another delightful experience while in Alappuzha is the houseboat cruise. The houseboats you find in the backwaters of 
                        Alappuzha are in fact a reworked version of the Kettuvallams of olden times. Kettuvallam is a Malayalam word, ‘Kettu’, refers to dwelling structures and ‘Vallom’ means boat. In the olden days, 
                        kettuvallam or boat with thatched roof that covers over wooden hulls was used to carry tons of rice and spices.Of late, houseboats come equipped with all the comforts of a good hotel room including furnished bedrooms, modern toilets, 
                         living rooms, a kitchen and even a balcony for angling. An uninterrupted view of life in the backwaters can be enjoyed while staying in a houseboat.</p>

                             in the elaborate forest of the majestic Western Ghats or Sahyadri Ranges in Kerala are  fourteen wildlife sanctuaries and 
                             two tiger reserves. Kerala also has six national parks containing protected and endangered species like the Indian Sloth-Bear, 
                             Lion-Tailed Macaque, Indian Bison, Bengal Tiger, Nilgiri Tahr etc.</strong>

                    <p>The eerie silence, emphasised by the missing Cicadas that gave Silent Valley its name, may make you feel and hear things you could never have imagined. A few centuries ago, before humans reached the Silent Valley, 
                        this reserve of tropical rainforests stood undisturbed and tranquil like a perfectly hidden diamond.Located in the Northeast corner of Palakkad district, Silent Valley was named a National Park only in 1984. 
                        It was called 'Sairandhrivanam' as it was here that Sairandhiri (the secret identity donned by Panchali, from the epic Mahabharata) is believed to have hidden along with her five husbands, the Pandavas,while escaping their cruel cousins, the Kauravas. 
                        The Kunthippuzha River which feeds the entire forest was named after Kunthi, mother of the Pandavas.It is shielded by the Nilgiri Plateau to the North and the Mannarkkad Plains to the South. It constitutes the centrepiece of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve,
                        an integral part of the Western Ghats, christened a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2012.The flora and fauna found here make one wonder if this ecosystem has survived since the very beginning of time. From tigers, leopards, elephants, snakes, 
                        Lion-Tailed Macaques and Malabar Giant Squirrels to moths, bugs and toads, the diversity in fauna is breathtaking. Along with them, one can view over 1,000 species of flowering plants and another 110 species of orchids that enchant all who see them.
                         Over 400 species of moths and 200 species of butterflies have been catalogued here. The 128 species of beetles deserve special mention since 10 of them were previously unknown to mankind.</p>

                    <h1 align="center">Districts in Kerala</h1>
                    <p>The Indian state of Kerala is divided into 14 districts. Districts are the major administrative units of a state which are further sub-divided into revenue divisions and taluks.Idukki district is the largest district in Kerala with a total land area of 4,61,223.14 hectares.
                        When the independent India merged smaller states together, Travancore and Cochin states were integrated to form Travancore-Cochin state on 1 July 1949. However, North Malabar and South Malabar remained under the Madras state. The States Reorganisation Act of 1 November 1956 elevated Kerala to statehood 
                        through the unification of Malayalam-speaking territories in the southwestern Malabar Coast of India.The state comprises three parts – the Northern Kerala districts of Kasaragod, Kannur, Wayanad, Kozhikode, Malappuram; the Central Kerala districts of Palakkad, Thrissur, Ernakulam, Idukki;and the Southern 
                        Kerala districts of Kottayam,Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Kollam, and Thiruvananthapuram.Such a regional division occurred being part of historical regions of Cochin, North Malabar, South Malabar, and Travancore.  The North Malabar region, which is culturally distinct from the rest of Kerala, entirely lies 
                        in the districts of Northern Kerala.North Malabar region includes Kasargod, Kannur,Wayanad, and the northern region of Kozhikode district, south Malabar region includes south-central part
                        of Kozhikode district, Malappuram, parts except Chittoor taluk of Palakkad district, Kunnamkulam and Chavakkad region of Thrissur district. The regions of South Malabar and Kingdom of Cochin, both of which share many historical, geographical, and cultural similarities, together constitute the districts of 
                        Central Kerala.The Travancore region is incorporated in the districts of South Kerala.The Travancore region was again divided into three zones as Northern Travancore (Hill Range)(Idukki District, Kottayam district and eastern portion of Ernakulam district), 
                        Central Travancore (Central Range)(Kollam district, Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha district) and Southern Travancore (Southern Range)(Thiruvananthapuram).</p>
